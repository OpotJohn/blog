      <h2>Latest News</h2>
      <p>There are several innovations and new technologies currently being developed and implemented in football. Here are two examples:<br>
        <ol> <li> VAR (Video Assistant Referee): VAR is a technology that allows referees to review decisions made during a match using video footage. The aim is to reduce errors made by officials and ensure that important decisions are accurate, such as goals, penalties, red cards, and mistaken identity.</li><br>
            <li>Goal-line technology: Goal-line technology is a system that uses cameras and sensors to determine whether a ball has crossed the goal-line. The system is used to help referees make more accurate decisions about whether a goal has been scored, which can be difficult to determine in fast-paced games with many players on the field.</li></ol>
